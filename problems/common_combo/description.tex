\problem{Common Combo}
{Consider an array $\{1,2,3\}$. There is exactly one subsequence that gives us the sum $1$, where we take the subsequence $\{1\}$. Similar,y there is exactly one subsequence that gives us the sum $5$, where we take the subsequence $\{2,3\}$. But there are two different subsequences that give us the sum $3$, where we take the subsequences $\{3\}$ and $\{1,2\}$.

This problem involves finding what sum has the most distinct subsequences that add to it.}
{Input consists of an integer $t$ where $1 \le t \le 100$. For every testcase $t$, you are given an integer $n$ where $1 \le n \le 100$, and $n$ positive integers in the form of an array $v$ where $\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} v_i \le 5000$}
{For every testcase, output value that appears most frequent as a sum of subsequences of $v$. If there are multiple equally frequent sums, output the smallest of the most frequent sums.}
