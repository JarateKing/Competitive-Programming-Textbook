\problem{Large and Small Pairs}
{The absolute difference between two integers, $|a - b|$, can be quickly calculated as the positive value of $a - b$. That is to say, if $a - b$ is negative, we turn it into a positive value instead.

In this problem, we have an array of integers and want to find the maximum and minimum absolute difference between any two pairs in the array.}
{Input consists of an integer $n$ where $1 \le n \le 10^7$, followed by $n$ integers $a_i$ where $0 \le a_i \le 10^9$.}
{Output the maximum absolute difference between any two pairs in $a$, followed by the minimum absolute difference between any two pairs in $a$.}
