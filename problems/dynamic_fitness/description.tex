{Welcome to Dynamic Fitness Gym Equipment Emporium! Here, we sell all sorts of gym equipment for all your fantastic gymnastic needs!

The special sale for today is on dumbbell weights. Name a target total weight and we can give you the right combination of weights to hit that target. We can do this for any weight in kilograms up to a whopping 2000kg!

Actually it'd be nice if someone could verify that for us. We think we have enough unique types of dumbbell weights in stock to combine them to match any target total weight, but we're not sure. Can someone count how many possible weights there are from combinations of weights?}
{Input consists of an integer $1 \le n \le 10^5$ for how many weights are given. What follows is $n$ integers $w_i$ where $1 \le w_i < 2000$ which represents the weight of the $i$th dumbbell weight. Weights are not necessarily unique.}
{Output the number of target total weights in the range $[0kg,2000kg)$ that can be obtained through some combination of the dumbbell weights given. A single dumbbell weight can only be used one or zero times.}
