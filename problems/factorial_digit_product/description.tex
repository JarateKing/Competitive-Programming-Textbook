\problem{Factorial Digit Product}
{The factorial of a number $n$ is denoted as $n!$. The math behind a factorial is $n! = 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * (n-1) * n$. In other words, the factorial of $n$ is the product of every number between $1$ and $n$ inclusive. The exception to this rule is when $n = 0$, where $0! = 1$. This is the same as $1!$ where $1! = 1$.

What we want to do is find the product of each individual digit of a factorial. For example, with $4!$ we get $1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24$, and the product of the digits of $24$ is $2 * 4 = 8$.}
{Input first consists of a number $t$ where $1 <= t <= 100000$. $t$ denotes how many test cases there are.

For each test case there is a number $n$ where $0 <= n <= 10^9$.}
{For each test case, print out the factorial digit product of $n$.}
