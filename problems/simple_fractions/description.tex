\problem{Simple Fractions}
{There are multiple ways to represent the same number. For example, $0.5$ can also be represented as $\frac{1}{2}$ or alternatively $\frac{2}{4}$ or even $\frac{50}{100}$. The simplified fraction is what we call the one with the smallest denominator: in this case $\frac{1}{2}$/.}
{Input consists of some number of decimal numbers $n$ where $0 < n < 1$ and $n$ has at most 6 significant figures.}
{For every number $n$, output that number in simplified fraction form.}
