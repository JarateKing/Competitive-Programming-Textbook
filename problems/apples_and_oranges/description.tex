\problem{Apples and Oranges}
{Alice has many apples, and Owen has many oranges. The two of them usually get along, as long as Alice doesn't accidentally eat any oranges and Owen doesn't accidentally eat any apples.

As a friendly competition, Alice suggests that they compare how many of each fruit they have. Owen agrees, sure that he has more oranges than Alice has apples. Alice believes that she has more apples though. In true competition fashion, they get a judge to count so that they can be sure.

Unfortunately, while the judge knows how to count, they don't know how to tell what number is bigger than the other. It's up to you to help finish the contest and properly declare the winner.}
{You are given two integers, $a$ and $b$ where $0 \leq a,b \leq 10^9$. $a$ represents the number of apples that Alice has, and $b$ represents the number of oranges that Owen has.}
{If Alice wins, print out "Alice". If Owen wins, print out "Owen". If it's a tie and neither wins, print out "Tie".}
