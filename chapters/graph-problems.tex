\subsection{Pathfinding}

One of the most common tasks with graphs is to find a path between two nodes, or the distance between them. As we will see, traversing the graph in this manner is a common subtask in several other, more complicated graph algorithms as well.

It's important to know that, in general, there isn't any single pathfinding algorithm that you should always use. Each have their own strengths and weaknesses that are only relevant in certain circumstances, or come with specific restrictions that make them only worthwhile on specific types of graphs.

\subsection{Union-Find}

Union-Find, which also goes by the name of \textit{disjoint-set}, is a data structure that groups connected nodes together into different subsets through operations called \textbf{union} (which connects two nodes together, akin to creating an edge) and \textbf{find} (which determines which subset a node belongs to).

\subsection{Minimum Spanning Trees}

Many graphs have redundant edges -- between nodes $A$ and $B$ there may be several different paths. A spanning tree of a connected graph is one in which we use a subset of edges (whether we think of it as removing redundant edges or building up only the necessary edges depends on the algorithm we use) so that every pair of nodes has exactly one unique path between them.

A minimum spanning tree is a variant of a general spanning tree, where we want to obtain the minimum total weight among all spanning trees.

\subsection{Eulerian Paths}

A Eulerian Path is a traversal of a graph in which every edge is visited exactly once. By consequence each node will also be visited one or more times.

Similarly, a Eulerian Cycle is a traversal of a graph that visits every edge exactly once with the added restriction that it's a cycle and has the same start and end node.

\subsection{Hamiltonian Paths}

A Hamiltonian Path is similar to a Eulerian Path except that it deals with nodes rather than edges -- it's a traversal in which each node is visited exactly once, and by consequence each edge is either visited once or not visited at all.

A Hamiltonian Cycle follows the same convention where we add the restriction that the end node of our traversal also has to be our source node.
