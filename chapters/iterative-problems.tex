Sometimes you will find problems along the lines of "here is a list of restrictions, construct an array that meets those restrictions" or "create the optimum answer under a list of restrictions". Usually, they also have some variant on "if there are multiple solutions, print any of them."

Generally, constructive problems require creative thinking to figure out a valid pattern that will satisfy the requirements. Usually, the implementation of a valid program itself is not very complicated, and it's being able to determine a valid pattern that is the challenging and interesting part of the problem.

Constructive problems are not necessarily iterative, but it's reasonable to introduce constructive problems here because many of them are.
