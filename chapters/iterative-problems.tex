Sometimes you will find problems along the lines of "here is a list of restrictions, construct an array that meets those restrictions" or "create the optimum answer under a list of restrictions". Usually, they also have some variant on "if there are multiple solutions, print any of them."

Generally, constructive problems require creative thinking to figure out a valid pattern that will satisfy the requirements. Usually, the implementation of a valid program itself is not very complicated, and it's being able to determine a valid pattern that is the challenging and interesting part of the problem.

Constructive problems are not necessarily iterative, but it's reasonable to introduce constructive problems here because many of them are.

We'll look at an example of a constructive problem:

\problem{Big Difference}
{"Big Difference!" Ivan said to his teacher, pointing at a list of numbers the teacher wrote on the board.

"That's right Ivan, there is a big difference here", the teacher said pointing to how the difference between every two elements in the list is fairly large. "In fact, I had carefully ensured that the difference between all elements was as large as possible, so that no elements next to each other was small." Specifically, the teacher made a list where the smallest (absolute) difference between every adjacent element was as large as possible.

Ivan wanted to figure out how to do this, but was not very fast at it. He couldn't figure out a way to solve it other than trying every different arrangement of the list, which was far too slow when he had a large list to deal with.}
{Input consists of a single integer $n$ where $1 \le n \le 10^8$.}
{Output an list of numbers of size $n$ with values $[1,2,3,...,n]$ where the smallest absolute difference between adjacent elements is maximized. More formally, create a permutation of an array $a$ with values $[1,n]$ with the maximum value of $min(|a_1-a_2|, |a_2-a_3|, ... |a_{n-1}-a_{n}|)$. If there are multiple answers, print any.}

There's a few things about this problem that stands out. The restriction is fairly basic -- we just have to make sure the minimum difference between adjacent elements is as large as possible. Our output is just a list of numbers between $1$ and $n$ that's ordered in a way that meets this restriction.

There can be multiple variants on this problem. It could also provide an input $k$ and ask that no two adjacent elements have an absolute difference less than $k$. It could ask for the lexicographically smallest answer if there are multiple (if $2 1 3$ and $3 1 2$ as both valid answers, the lexicographically smallest answer would be $2 1 3$ since $2$ is less than $3$).
