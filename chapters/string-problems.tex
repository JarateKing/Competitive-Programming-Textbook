\subsection{String Concepts}
\subsubsection{Anagrams}

Anagrams are the string equivalent to a permutation of an array. Two strings are anagrams of eachother if they contain the same elements, but their ordering isn't necessarily the same. For example, "abc" and "bac" are anagrams. Similarly, all anagrams of "abc" are \{"abc","acb","bac","bca","cab","cba"\}.

\subsubsection{Palindromes}

Palindromes are strings that are the same when they're reversed. For example, "abccba" or "abcba" are both palindromes, whereas "abcde" isn't.

It can be pretty easy to check if a string is a palindrome or not. We can simply check whether the first half of characters are equal to the second half of characters.
