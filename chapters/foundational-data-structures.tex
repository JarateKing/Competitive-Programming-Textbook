\section{Foundational Data Structures}
\subsection{Arrays}

Arrays are the most basic data structure in most programming languages. It is very simple in its functionality: instead of storing a single value like a regular variable does, it stores some amount of values.

\subsubsection{Dynamic Arrays}

Arrays don't have to be a fixed size -- dynamic arrays allow you to dynamically resize the array when you need more space to put new elements.

In C++ we have the \mintinline{cpp}{std::vector} class that works as our dynamic array. In Java, it's \mintinline{java}{ArrayList}. And in Python, lists are already dynamic arrays.
