\section*{Notation}

A brief description of some of the mathematical notation used in this book might be useful, because not everyone reading this may be overly familiar with some of them:
\begin{itemize}
\item when describing a list or set, we will usually denote it as $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$. Multiple sets or lists have the notation $\{1,2\},\{3,4\},\{5,6\}$.
\item inclusive ranges are given in the form of $[x,y]$ that represents every value beginning with $x$ (including $x$) and ending with $y$ (including $y$). For example, the range $[1,5]$ includes the values $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$.
\item ranges may also exclude a value, by using $($ or $)$ instead of $[$ and $]$. The one most often encountered would be $[x,y)$, where we have a range from $x$ (including $x$) to $y$ (not including $y$). As a result, $[1,5)$ is the values $\{1,2,3,4\}$.
\item modular arithmetic follows code-like conventions, where we use $\%m$ to denote numbers $mod$ $m$. For example, adding $2$ and $3$ under modulo $7$ would look like $2 + 3 \% 7 = 5 \% 7$.
\end{itemize}

There is some specific notation we will use in this book as well, that we will cover here.
\begin{itemize}
\item individual elements of an array are addressed, 0-indexed, as $arr[i]$ where $arr$ is the array and $i$ is the index, or with constants such as $arr[0]$.
\item subarrays use the notion $arr[i:j]$ for elements in the range $[i,j)$, similar to how Python handles subarrays.
\item strings are surrounded by double-quotes like \mintinline{cpp}{"string"}.
\item individual characters are surrounded by single-quotes like \mintinline{cpp}{'c'}. Characters such as newlines are given as \mintinline{cpp}{'\n'}.
\end{itemize}
