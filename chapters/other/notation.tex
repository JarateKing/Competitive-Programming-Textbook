\section*{Notation}

There is some specific notation we will use in this book, that we will cover here.
\begin{itemize}
\item when describing a list or set, we will usually denote it as $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$. Multiple sets or lists have the notation $\{1,2\},\{3,4\},\{5,6\}$.
\item individual elements of an array are addressed, 0-indexed, as $arr[i]$ where $arr$ is the array and $i$ is the index, or with constants such as $arr[0]$.
\item subarrays use the notion $arr[i:j]$ for elements in the range $[i,j)$, similar to how Python handles subarrays.
\item strings are surrounded by double-quotes like \mintinline{cpp}{"string"}.
\item individual characters are surrounded by single-quotes like \mintinline{cpp}{'c'}. Characters such as newlines are given as \mintinline{cpp}{'\n'}.
\end{itemize}
