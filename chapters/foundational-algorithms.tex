\section{Foundational Algorithms}

There are a few algorithms that should be covered and discussed before going into much further explorations.

\subsection{Sorting}

\subsection{Searching}

There are various algorithms for searching for an element within an array.

\subsubsection{Sequential Search}

Sequential search is the simplest form of searching for an element within an array. It consists of a simple for-loop that checks each individual element 

It's useful because it doesn't rely on the array being sorted or anything like that. While it is often quite slow, it can be useful when runtime is not a concern.

\subsubsection{Binary Search}

Binary search is an extremely common search algorithm that uses the structure of a sorted array to offer great speedups.

\subsubsection{Unimodal Searches}

Less commonly, you may want to search the outputs of a function rather than an array. There are some search algorithms designed to search for maximums or minimums in a unimodal function (a function that has only one unique maximum or minimum).
