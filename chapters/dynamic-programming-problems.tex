Dynamic programming is...

Consider the problem of calculating the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is the sequence $0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,...$ where each value (other than the initial $0,1$) is the sum of the previous two (so $89 = 55 + 34$, $55 = 34 + 21$, $34 = 21 + 13$, and so on). This is a pretty intuitive example of recursion, like in:
