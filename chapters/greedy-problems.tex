\section{Greedy Problems}

Greedy problems are problems where the optimal solution can always be developed by, at each opportunity, making the choices that provide the most immediate benefit. In other words, the locally optimal choice is also the globally optimal choice, in all circumstances. Practically, this just means that at any given step of an algorithm, we can reasonably and reliably make the best choice we can.

For example, a simple greedy problem might look like:

This is greedy because...

While a slightly modified problem stops being greedy:

Here, this is problem is no longer greedy because...
